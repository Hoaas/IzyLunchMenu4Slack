# izy.as menu to Slack
Slack integration for the lunch menu for the building at [Vitaminveien 4, Oslo, Norway](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Vitaminveien+4,+0485+Oslo), but should in theory work for any building using the same system.

Menu fetched from the API behind the [Workplace Oo app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=no.fourservice.workplace). (https://workplace.izy.as/)

- Fetches menu from endpoints used by app
- Sends menu to ChatGPT to get a better query for the next step
- Searches Bing Images for an image of the menu item - picks a random one from the top 10 results

## Issues
You need to use a user account to get access, but this causes the user to be logged out other places ... so that's a bit annoying.
